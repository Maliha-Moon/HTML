<!--? 1:How do you create a paragraph using the <p> tag? -->
<!--? 2: Can you nest other HTML elements inside a <p> tag? -->
<!--NO, the <p> tag is a block-level(block of text) element, and it cannot contain block-level elements like other paragraphs
    or headings. However, you can include inline elements like <strong>, <em> and links.-->
