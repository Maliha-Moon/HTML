<!--* HTML ANCHOR TAG - ATTRIBUTES
<!-- *---------------------------------------- -->

<!-- href: Specifies the URL or destination the link points to.

target: Specifies where the linked content will be displayed (e.g., _blank for a new window/tab).

download: Suggests that the target will be downloaded when clicked.

rel: Describes the relationship between the current page and the linked page.

title: Provides additional information when hovering over the link.

id: Assigns a unique identifier to the anchor for linking within the page.

class: Assigns a class for styling or JavaScript interactions.

style: Applies inline CSS styling to the anchor.

tabindex: Specifies the tab order when navigating using the keyboard.

accesskey: Defines a keyboard shortcut to activate the link.

aria-*: Attributes for accessibility purposes (e.g., aria-label). -->

<!-- *------------------------------------- -->
<!--* INTERVIEW QUESTIONS: HTML ANCHOR TAG  
<!-- *---------------------------------------- -->

<!--* 1: How can you create a link within the same webpage that takes the user to a specific section or element on the page? -->
<!-- To create a link that takes the user to a specific section or element within the
same webpage, you can use the anchor (a) tag's href attribute along with the id attribute of the target element. -->

<!--* 2: What's the difference between relative and absolute URLs in the href attribute? -->
<!-- Relative URLs are URLs that are relative to the current page's URL(without the "https://www" part). 
  Absolute URLs are complete URLs (root/original path), including the protocol (http/https) and domain. -->

<!--* 3: How does the download attribute work in the anchor tag? -->
<!-- The download attribute suggests that the linked resource should be downloaded instead of navigated to, prompting the user to download the file. -->

<!--* 4: How do you create an HTML link that opens the user's default email client with a specific email address? -->


<!--* 5: How can you create a clickable link in HTML that allows users to directly initiate a phone call when clicked? -->
<!-- To create a link that enables users to initiate a phone call when clicked, you can use the anchor tag's href attribute with the tel: protocol.  -->



<!-- *------------------------------------- -->
<!--* BONUS: HTML ANCHOR TAG  
<!-- *---------------------------------------- -->

<!--* ALSO WHEN TO USE QUOTES, WHEN NOT TO  -->

<!--# <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a>
    <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage>favorite website</a>
> -->
<!-- So the best practice is Always include the attribute quotes. It avoids such problems, and results in more readable code. -->

<!--* Single or double quotes?  -->
<!--# <a href="https://www.example.com">A link to my example.</a>

<a href="https://www.example.com">A link to my example.</a> -->

<!-- mixing both the quotes at the same time is wrong -->
<!-- ❌ <a href="https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a> -->

<!-- However, if you use one type of quote, you can include the other type of quote inside your attribute values: -->
<!--# <a href="https://www.example.com" title="Isn't this fun?">
  A link to my example.
</a> -->
